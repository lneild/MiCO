## My Instant Container Opener
Every student in McCormick, the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Northwestern University, takes the class Design, Thinking and Communication. In this class, students are divided into teams of four and given ten weeks and $100 to solve a problem. 

Our client was an 18-year-old male at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab recovering from spinal cord and nerve damage because of a gunshot injury. Reduced strength and limited movement inhibit the user’s ability to open various containers, from toothpaste bottles to peanut butter jars. Moreover, existing market solutions have proved ineffective for our user.

Our solution is MiCO: the My Instant Container Opener. MiCO brings a unique perspective to the container-opening game. Building off an existing market solution designed to help older adults with arthritis open containers, MiCO optimizes this product for a user in a wheelchair. Our solution consists of one main assembly— a plastic disc with metal teeth for traction with Velcro on top to securely attach to the armrest— and an optional, protective safety sleeve. 

Today, our client uses this product frequently, and this class has provided me with a true sense of accomplishment and gratitude.
